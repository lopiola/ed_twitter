Twitter is a bottomless source of web content, as data is published there by thousands of people every second. Thanks to its simplicity and availability, everyone can be a part of this enormous society. It allows to exchange opinions on various topics, share with other people, stay up to date with latest news and many more. 

In this project, we decided to explore the use of Twitter by football fans and specialists. We have chosen an ideal moment for the survey - a football feast that is UEFA Champions League. Having gathered a huge amount of tweets posted during a single eliminations round, we continued to examine social dependencies that appeared in collected tweets.
